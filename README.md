# Shiny-application-Bookstore-dashboard

A dashboard which presents trending books along with their ratings on GoodReads. The book prices were taken from Ebay.

On the topleft you can see a table of books. There you can search a book by its name or its author, as well as you can specify a rating-range for all books.
When you select a title you can see the ratings given for that book.
Near the ratings we will present the estimated total sales of the books. How many people had read the book and how many reviews it has on good reads. On bottom Left you can see the countries were the book was the most popular. ( We identify it by the user's who had read the book and had had specified his/her country.
Near it there are two plots showing book's popularity in different age categories and how popular are book's subgenres.

Also the app was written in shiny we had separate css to ensure plots are on the positions we want them to be. ( That is, they follow the Gestalt principles)
